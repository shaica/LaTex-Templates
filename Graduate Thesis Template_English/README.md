This template is prepared for my own Master's Thesis. So there may be some packages missing. This template is not complete. For example I did not need landscape pages for my thesis, so the required specifications are missing. You can edit the file as you like however if you can contribute to this file it will be awesome because others might as well use this template. I am sharing this template for helping fellow grad students at Yildiz Technical University. Soon I will be writing my doctoral thesis, so there will be updates. Do not forget to check for updates, occasionally. You can look up for my thesis with ID number #378365 from [here.][YOK_TEZ].
